# Modern CMake Sample

Sample project that shows proper modern CMake usage **testfoo** on a dummy library **foo** and an executable that uses it.

Thanks to the article [It's Time To Do CMake Right](https://pabloariasal.github.io/2018/02/19/its-time-to-do-cmake-right/)

As usual:
 - mkdir build
 - cd build
 - cmake ..
 - make install
